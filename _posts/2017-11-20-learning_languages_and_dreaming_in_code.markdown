A little over one month ago I began the Flatiron School curriculum. During the 3-month defferal period of my "Women in Tech" scholarship, I took the time to get a better understanding of not only *what* I was learning, but *how*. 

I began the Flatiron School Full Stack Web Development program a little over a month ago. Having earned a "Women in Tech" scholarship with the program 3-months prior, I was reaching a defferal deadline and needed to make a decision about the program. Already experienced with the prep-course work, I ultimately decided to proceed with the program.

The first week, I didn't put too much time into the program; during the time, I was working a physically gruelling PA gig as a sidehustle and the funding for my participation in this program. After securing myself financially and an exhausting week, it wasn't long that replaced my 60hr PA workweek with intensive immersion into the coding realm and all its langugages. 

Treating the program as a full-time opportunity, there were times I'd work on coding for 10hrs straight. It was constant and consistent, perhaps even bordering on obsessive. My interest in learning struck intensely and quickly, driving me through the first month of the program. There was something strangely satisfying reading out "0 failures" at the end of each lab and finally crafting a coding solution that ultimately demonstrates an in-depth understanding of the language and a full grasping of its rules and methods, cluminating in the execution of such methods. 

Similar to when learning a foreign language, I began dreaming in code. All actions in my dreams began functioning via JavaScript and Ruby methods. While strange, for me this establishes a personal victory; a demonstraion of true understanding and immersion. And thus begins my coding journey with Flatiron School.
