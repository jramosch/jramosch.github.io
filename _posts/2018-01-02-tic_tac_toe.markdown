This post initially began as an upbeat and energetic celebration of speedily diving into and acing the Tic-Tac-Toe with AI lab. I was slamming through all the tests. Greenlighting most of them with effortless ease and then suddenly... the AI. Of course if you don't really care what moves your AI is making, getting the initial test to pass is pretty much a breeze. But if we're talking about making your program a little smarter, to really get the I in AI, there's a little more worke to be done. 

Suddenly the TicTacToe project became my Goliath and I felt just as small as David. I always knew Ask-A-Question was an excellent resource, having used it in the past with great, swift results. So of course this was my first top when I came upon my first neverending loop, which undoubtedly crashed my older version of Learn IDE. 

But those behind Ask-A-Question aren't omnipotent, they're just programmers -- like everyother Flatiron School student is soon-to-be. She was initially stumped as well and it took multiple tactics and several crashes to figure out the line of code sending me in a loop. Despite the great help, I wasn't out of the woods yet. My AI simply wasn't working well. 

It wasn't till I began talking with other students that I really found my answer. While Ask-A-Question is a great resource for Flatiron Labs/Projects, classmates are another great resource as well. While you may have different approaches to the same probelm, your coding solutions looking vastly different at the end of it all, having to communicate your mental workings truly aids in wrapping your mind around your code. 

Without others to bounce my ideas off of and really verbalize my mental process, I don't think I would've been able to make it through the project. While it's great to immerse yourself in the learning process, other people are extremely necessary to the learning process and I'll be sure to reach out more often.
