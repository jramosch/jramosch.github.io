Oh, the Rails Project... I don't think I quite understood what I was taking on with the Rails project. Perhaps it's something like looking at a mountain peak, which seems reachable and yet, regardless of how many hours you've been climbing, it still looks pretty damn far away. This isn't to say that previous projects didn't put me into fits of anxiety or stress, but looking back I wish this project was as easy as those that came before. 

My first hurdle came into handling testing my project on a local server. Oh, how I took the LearnIDE for granted, mostly because it continually crashed in spotty WiFi or didn't always commit my changes to Github. At the same time, the LearnIDE is really just a set of training wheels and the Rails project, at least for me, signaled the time to take them off. 

Now, Learn actually recommends you don't set up your local environment [until you complete your Sinatra Project](http://help.learn.co/technical-support/local-environment/when-should-i-set-up-a-local-environment), but my frustrations with launching a workable server drove me to it! 

[Setting up a local environment for the Mac OSX](http://help.learn.co/technical-support/local-environment/mac-osx-manual-environment-set-up) isn't actually all that challenging, so if you're experiencing extreme difficulties setting up a server to work with and have exchausted most avenues, I suggest making the big leap. It actually feels like a true accomplishment once you do set it up and start working outside of the sandbox Learn provides. Congrats on taking the training wheels off!

Once that hurdle was accomplished, developing my project started to run much smoother. Toggling between adding some code and seeing my efforts materialize in (sorta) realtime on my localhost server. It was easy to establish a workflow along the lines of: code some, test on server, make corrections, test again, and commit final changes! 

Everything seemed to be running smoothly and I even recall confidently telling my educational coach how I was nearly done. Little did I know I was working off the wrong checklist all along and, maybe I was the only one to make this oversight, but the [initial checklist you review during your project prep](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1G2iMtEe49uY22xMxuGMY4J7FPKd8p3Xw3_M_lkXgEfI/edit) is not the one you need to check off for your final work. Suddenly looking at the *actual* checklist, the project felt a little more daunting, but not insurmountable. 

For those who might be working off a false sense of confidence like I was, just keep the [actual checklist](https://github.com/learn-co-students/rails-assessment-v-000/blob/master/spec.md) in mind for your initial planning. I wish I did. Fortunately, it only took a million Google searches to regain that confidence in making nested resources with the correct corresponding controller. (Hint: [StackOverFlow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14945754/rails-nested-resources-and-routing-how-to-break-up-controllers) is a great resource for questions you might have. If you have the questions, it's likely someone else did.)

Everyone has their own approach to every project, but for me - and perhaps many others - I recommend starting with your database, then your models, then your controllers, and finally yoru views. Along with the workflow of continially testing your changes via your server (`rails s`). And don't forget to commit and to commit often. [Atom](https://atom.io/) - a great text editor recommended by Learn - has a handy feature of keeping track of your changes that have yet to be commited! 

With that and my project finally finished, I wish all those who have yet to complete good luck and hopefully you won't have as rocky of a time as I did. Or maybe you will and it can feel like you've topped your own Mt Everest.
