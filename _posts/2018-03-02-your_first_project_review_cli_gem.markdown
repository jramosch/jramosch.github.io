I was anxiety-ridden prior to my project review for my CLI gem. Coupled with a recent death in the family, I was in absolutely no mood for the review and even pushed it back by a week the first go around. Despite my reviewer, Kenlyn Terai, having a very friendly email manner, self-doubt and nervousness lingered.

In my attempts to alieve some of this [[anxiety]], I studied for days, even during my 9-to-5 whenver my supervisors weren't looking. While easily becoming more familiar with terms, I still felt like I wasn't sure what I was preparing for. 

On the day of my review, I made sure to let Kenlyn know that, because I was leaving from my job, there was a slight chance I'd be late to my own review. She was totally understanding. 

After rushing home, hoping that the subway system was suffering from too many delays that day, I speedily fired up my computer and opened up to my github where my CLI gem code was stored. Kenlyn asked if it would be okay for another instructor to join, more to observe than me, but still anxiety heightened! 

And I must say -- to anyone with similar feelings about this event. Everything is going to be fine. Even in the write up for the review, Flatiron ensured there would be no harsh criticisms or punishment, and this was a true claim. Kenlyn was nothing but patient and reassuring, even providing helpful hints if necessary. She continually assured me that I was doing great and that I should be proud of my work. One of the most [[reassuring]] things she said was that anything I felt less than confident in I would surely learn as I progressed in the program. That, like many other skills, I would improve over time with more practice. 

So don't sweat the first project review; it really isn't going to be as bad as you would initially think, but that could be said of a lot of tasks. However, the helpful guidance and undestanding nature of Flatiron's instructors goes a long way in making you feel more confident in your abilities. Remember, it'll come with practice and time.
